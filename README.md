## Capstone Project: Take Flight
=========================

## Project Overview
One area of interest for me is transportation, especially for either airline or automotive industry. A challenge an airline could potentially face is cost benefit analysis of its flight and the number of flights to the number of destinations. To optimize and maximize profit for a flight, which destinations result in flights with near full capacity? Also on the other hand, which destinations result in flights with near empty capacity? My project could address which destinations are trending up or down throughout the season and over the years. Based on the trend, forecast whether it would be beneficial to add flights or reduce flights to those destinations.
